# Licensing

This repository holds two kinds of material and they are licensed differently.

## Material inherited from upstream

- **Mesa** (MIT) — https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa

Every file that came from an upstream project stays under that project's
license. Nothing here relicenses it, and modifications to those files do not
relicense them either — a patched upstream file is still an upstream file.

## Material written for DroidVM

Files carrying `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later` are DroidVM work
and are licensed under the GNU GPL, version 2 or later, **with the
additional permissions in `ADDITIONAL-PERMISSIONS`**.

Those permissions exist so this work can go upstream. They let anyone
relicense it under the terms an upstream project requires, for the purpose of
getting it merged there — and only for that purpose. Once upstream publishes
it, upstream's license governs that copy.

## Third-party material that is neither

None added. DroidVM's work in this repository is almost entirely edits to
upstream MIT files, which stay MIT — a patched upstream file is still an
upstream file, and those edits are offered upstream as MIT.

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Sign-off is required; there is no CLA.
